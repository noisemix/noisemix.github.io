How does this compare to pre-trained vectors?

## Implementation
Char-level vs word-level
Link to Appendix / Noise Types

## Results
vs baseline
vs more real data
% improvement, % errors cut

## Conclusion

1 - Noisification is very effective.
2 - Most of the features that are meaninful for a given task can be packed in few rows,

One drawback is longer training time.

### Future work
Learn noisification models from raw data or pre-trained vectors

## Appendix

### Noise Types

### Example Output
